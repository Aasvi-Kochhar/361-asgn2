## What is this folder for?

Add your test collections here. The collection that you create must have three files, with the same name and extensions `.ALL`, `QRY`, and `REL`. 

## The `CISI_bool` collection

Only the documents from the original CISI collection will be used. The (Boolean) queries and the answers were created by the CMPUT361 instructors. To avoid confusion, we are using a different collection name: `CISI_bool`. 

The format of the files has not changed from last assignment.
